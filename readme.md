<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
Hello! I'm **Minho** :)

I love talking about science. I am a Computer Engineer and researcher currently living in Brazil. My research topics includes _control theory_, _machine learning_, _dynamical systems_ and a lot of other math and physics related topics.

Since these topics are currently _very hot_, I got to be invited to speak about them in several events to several audiences (from high-school to graduate students). Being an [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) advocate, I believe that everything that I do - in that context - should be publicly available. This is the motivation to this repository, in which I will upload the codes/slides of everything I present.

Use as your will! Enjoy :)

_Ps.:_ credits are appreciated, but not demanded.
